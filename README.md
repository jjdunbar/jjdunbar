### Hi there! 👋,

I’m jjdunbar, an Enterprise Security Architect and Cybersecurity Professional. 

📈 Fun fact, I have a degree in computing for business & e-commerce with a major in marketing. 

I'm currently obsessed with OSINT, CTI, open source tooling as well as designing and growing my own cybersecurity home-lab.

Outside of that I’m a proud and active member of some of the world’s leading professional security associations:

- ISACA
- The SANS Institute
- AISA

I am also a member of TryHackMe, the Tech Council of Australia (TCA) and ISC2.

- 🛠️ I'm currently working on building my cybersecurity home lab and super excited to reveal what that looks like shortly.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning CASP+ and SABSA to keep my skills current. 
- 🎮 I initially fell in love with cybersecurity after a childhood love for the classic PC game C&C Tiberian Sun.
- 💬 You'll have to ask me about the link between C&C Tiberian Sun and the cybersecurity industry.
