### Hi there! 👋,

I’m Dunbar, a technology leader and security all-rounder currently working in security architecture, regulatory compliance, data privacy and risk. I’m a proud and active member of some of the world’s leading professional associations:

- ISACA
- The SANS Institute
- AISA

I am also a member of TryHackMe, Tech Council of Australia (TCA) and ISC2.

- 🛠️ I'm currently working on building my cybersecurity home lab. 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning CASP+ and SABSA.
- 📈 Fun fact, I have a degree in computing for business & e-commerce with a major in marketing.
- 🎮 I initially fell in love with cybersecurity after a childhood love for the classic PC game C&C Tiberian Sun.
- 💬 You'll have to ask me about the link between C&C Tiberian Sun and the cybersecurity industry.
