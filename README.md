### Hello World 👋,

I'm jjdunbar, an Enterprise Security Architect with a passion for cybersecurity and a fervent advocate for digital privacy.

📈 Interesting fact, I have a degree in computing for business & e-commerce with a major in marketing, which I accept is not often a traditional background for cybersecurity / digital privacy. 

I am currently fascinated with the world of OSINT, CTI, open-source tooling and I'm actively designing and building my cybersecurity home-lab. 

While those interests may seem contradictory to my privacy advocacy, I'm deeply committed to empowering individuals with the knowledge to safeguard their own digital identities and I'm keen to work with folks to explore this domain further. To this day the trade-offs between cybersecurity <> privacy fascinate me. 

Outside of this realm, I’m a proud and active member of some of the world’s leading professional security associations:

- ISACA
- The SANS Institute
- AISA

I'm also a member of TryHackMe, the Tech Council of Australia (TCA) and ISC2.

### A bit more about me

- 🛠️ I'm currently working on building my cybersecurity home-lab and super stoked to reveal what that looks like shortly.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning CASP+ and SABSA to help keep my skills current. 
- 🎮 I initially fell in love with cybersecurity after a childhood love for the classic PC game C&C Tiberian Sun.
- 💬 You'll have to ask me about the link between C&C Tiberian Sun and the cybersecurity industry.
