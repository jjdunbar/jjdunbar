### Hello World 👋,

I'm jjdunbar, an Enterprise Security Architect with a passion for cybersecurity and a fervent advocate for digital privacy.

📈 Interesting fact, I have a degree in computing for business & e-commerce with a major in marketing 🤨 ...

My current obsession lies in the realm of OSINT, CTI, and open-source tooling, where I'm actively engaged in designing and expanding my cybersecurity home-lab. While this may seem contradictory to my privacy advocacy, I'm deeply committed to empowering individuals with the knowledge to safeguard their digital identities and I'm keen to work with folks to explore this area further. 

Outside of this, I’m a proud and active member of some of the world’s leading professional security associations:

- ISACA
- The SANS Institute
- AISA

I'm also a member of TryHackMe, the Tech Council of Australia (TCA) and ISC2.

### A bit more about me

- 🛠️ I'm currently working on building my cybersecurity home-lab and super stoked to reveal what that looks like shortly.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning CASP+ and SABSA to help keep my skills current. 
- 🎮 I initially fell in love with cybersecurity after a childhood love for the classic PC game C&C Tiberian Sun.
- 💬 You'll have to ask me about the link between C&C Tiberian Sun and the cybersecurity industry.
